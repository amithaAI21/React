of the Virtual DOM and updates the difference in the actual DOM>
b) Resuable Components based- Components needs to be written a single time and can be used multiple times by just calling that component where we require that component.
c) One-way Data Binding - it prevents the data in a component from flowing backward. A component can pass the data to its child component only.This simply data handling and reduce the complexity.
d) Better and Faster Performance
e) Extremely Flexible
d) Creates dynamic applications easily
e) Develops Mobile Applications as well
